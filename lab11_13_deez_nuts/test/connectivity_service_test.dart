      // 1. Refactor ConnectivityService to allow injection of StreamController or Connectivity.
      // 2. Use a "fake" implementation of Connectivity, or a test-specific ConnectivityService.
      //
      // For this "no modification" approach, mocking the stream is generally not feasible
      // or meaningful because you'd just be mocking the mock.
      //
      // For demonstration, if it *were* possible to mock the stream directly:
      // when(mockConnectivityService.connectionStatus)
      //     .thenAnswer((_) => Stream.value(true));
      // expect(mockConnectivityService.connectionStatus, emits(true));
      //
      // Since direct mocking of the internal stream logic isn't possible,
      // this test would likely become an integration test with the real plugin.
      //
      // We'll skip this test to keep it simple and within the "no modification" constraint,
      // as mocking the stream directly would only mock the mock, not the actual
      // ConnectivityService's internal stream logic.
